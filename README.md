# SQL Tables for Financial Inclusion Dataset

This repository contains SQL tables designed to organize and analyze a dataset related to financial inclusion, including account ownership, digital payments, savings, borrowing, and more. The dataset includes variables such as respondent demographics, financial behaviors, and COVID-19 impacts.

---

## **Overview**
The dataset contains information about respondents from various economies, including their financial behaviors, account ownership, and usage of digital financial services. The SQL tables are normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The tables are designed to answer questions related to financial inclusion, digital payments, savings, borrowing, and more.

The dataset is sourced from the **World Bank Microdata Library**: [https://microdata.worldbank.org](https://microdata.worldbank.org).

## **Visualization Use Cases**
These SQL tables can be used to create insightful visualizations for the following topics:

1. **Account Ownership and Usage**
   - Visualize the percentage of respondents with accounts (financial institution, mobile money) across economies.
   - Compare account ownership by gender, age, or education level.

2. **Digital Payments**
   - Analyze trends in digital payment adoption (e.g., debit/credit card usage, mobile money transactions).
   - Visualize the impact of COVID-19 on digital payment adoption.

3. **Savings and Borrowing**
   - Explore savings behaviors (e.g., saving for old age, using financial institutions vs. mobile money).
   - Visualize borrowing patterns (e.g., sources of borrowing, medical or emergency loans).

4. **Wages, Transfers, and Pensions**
   - Map the distribution of wage payments, government transfers, and pensions across economies.
   - Compare methods of receiving payments (e.g., into accounts, mobile money, or cash).

5. **Financial Worries**
   - Visualize the most common financial worries (e.g., medical costs, old age, education).
   - Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on financial stress.

6. **Remittances**
   - Explore remittance trends (e.g., sending/receiving domestic remittances).
   - Compare methods of sending remittances (e.g., through accounts, cash, or mobile money).

7. **Agricultural Payments**
   - Visualize the distribution of agricultural payments and methods of receiving them.
   - Analyze the relationship between agricultural activities and financial inclusion.

8. **Utility Payments**
   - Compare methods of paying utility bills (e.g., online, mobile, or cash).
   - Visualize the shift to digital payments for utilities post-COVID-19.

9. **Mobile and Internet Access**
   - Analyze the correlation between mobile phone ownership, internet access, and financial inclusion.
   - Visualize the adoption of mobile money accounts by mobile phone ownership.

10. **COVID-19 Impact**
    - Visualize the financial impact of COVID-19 (e.g., first-time digital payments, financial worries).
    - Analyze changes in financial behaviors due to the pandemic.
